Web app providing easy way of building/updating progress clocks for PbtA RPG games.

Main features(WIP):
1. Chosing clock size: 4, 6, 8 etc.
2. Graphical representation
3. Description of each part, description of clock, name of clock
4. Way to update progress of the clock. Storing clock on individual user Google Drive.

Feel free to leave comments regarding my work. I'm learning python coding, CI, CD, Cloud Services, Automation. Any comment contributing to my development will be appreciated.
Thank you
